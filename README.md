# GraphQL

replacement or alternative to REST Api

Rest API - stateless, client-independent API for exchanging data

Limitation:
works with endpoints such as Get, post, fetch, put
Rest API always sends all the data even if we dont need it

GraphQL - stateless, client-independent API for exchanging data with higher query flexibility
